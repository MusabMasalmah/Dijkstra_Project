## Introduction

Dijkstra's algorithm is a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. In this project, it has been applied to a graph representing the connections between cities in Palestine. The goal is to provide a tool for calculating the most efficient routes between these cities.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities.
- **City Graph:** Represents the connections between cities as a graph, with distances as edge weights.
