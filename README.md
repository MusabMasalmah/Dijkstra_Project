# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm for Palestinian Cities

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm in the C programming language to find the shortest path between cities in Palestine. The program considers the distances between cities and computes the most efficient route from a source city to a destination city.

## Introduction

Dijkstra's algorithm is a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. In this project, it has been applied to a graph representing the connections between cities in Palestine. The goal is to provide a tool for calculating the most efficient routes between these cities.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities.
- **City Graph:** Represents the connections between cities as a graph, with distances as edge weights.

## Input Format

Akka Haifa 35km  
Akka Nazareth 33km  
Akka Jenin 74km  
Bethlehem Hebron 45km  
Bethlehem Jerusalem 9km

## Output Format

 (252 : Jenin) <--  (203 : Haifa) <--  (146 : Tulkarem) <--  (93 : Salfit) <--  (55 : Ramallah) <--  (34 : Jerusalem) <--  (0 : Hebron) <--
